# color_quantization
In this rapo a flow-based image abstraction operation is proposed for anti-artifact. Proposing the flow-based image abstraction before clustering tames the color variation and introduces continuous adjacent edges to increase the quantization quality. The quantization pipeline consists of two parts, the stage of abstraction and k-means clustering.
